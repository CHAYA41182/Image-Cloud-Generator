# Image-Cloud-Generator

Like word clouds, this is a utility that generates an image cloud.


## Usage
Generate a template JSON with name `example.json`, as in `example.py`, then run:
```bash
python img_gen.py
```

Note that image files are added to the canvas as orders specified by the json file. 

Enjoy!

## FYI
For the power of randomization, feel free to run it multiple times to pick your favorite!

You can reuse the randomly generated coordinates from the corresponding `.pickle`. 

Also, feel free to play with the constant values in `img_gen`.
