Like word clouds, this is a utility that generates an image cloud.


## To use 
Generate a template JSON with name `example.json`, as in `example.py`, then run:
```bash
python img_gen.py
```

Enjoy!

## FYI
For the power of randomization, feel free to run it multiple times to pick your favorite! 

For the same reason, it might not terminate. 

Also, feel free to play with the constant values in `img_gen`.
